# Project-2-430

This project during my time in a Rich Media Web App Development class at RIT. In this project, I was tasked to use express.js to create an interesting and engaging web app along side React.js for the front 
end and using MongoDB as the database for the back end. The website I created was designed to be a web app where a user could create an account and, using this account, upload songs of there own and 
like the songs of other users. Even when not logged in, visiters could browse the homepage, search for songs and users on the site, and view other users profiles.

If I were to take this project further, my first goal would be to convert the whole web app into a single page application. This has many advantages both in terms of server organization and how the information gets 
displayed, but the biggest goal this step would lead to is creating an audio bar at the bottom of the page that continues to play the audio file the user selected to play even when switching from the homepage to 
a user's page. After that, I would start looking into improving the bios of the user to allow a user to create a more personalized page as well as additional features such as playlists, uploading multiple songs as 
albums, etc. Finally, I would want to take another deep look at the styling for the whole website and see what steps I could take to improve how the view is presented to a user.
